# Dancing-Meatball
A sketch made with Processing(Java) that reacts to ambient noise to create a color and size changing rotating meatball(low-poly sphere).

## About the Meatball
In truth, it's not really a meatball at all. . . rather, a low-poly sphere made up of triangles, in which some triangles are colored and some are not, to give a kind of semi-skeletal appearance. Using the sound library for Processing, the meatball changes size, color, and orientation based on scaled input values from the audio your computer detects.

### In Summary
In exercise in how effectively I can make and promote a 'meatball' in 30 minutes on a rainy day.
